## 🎯 What is OpenDialer?

OpenDialer is a **browser-based power dialer** you self-host on your own infrastructure. Plug in your [Telnyx](https://telnyx.com) API keys, upload contacts, upload voicemail recordings, and start dialing — all from the browser with a headset.

**This is NOT an AI voice agent.** This is a classic power dialer built for teams:

- 👥 **Multi-user team dialing** — multiple operators share a campaign queue, system dials in parallel
- 🔀 **Parallel dialing** — dials 3x the number of available operators simultaneously
- 🎯 **Auto-routing** — human-answered calls auto-route to the first available operator (FIFO fairness)
- 🤖 **Answering Machine Detection (AMD)** — automatically detects voicemail vs. human
- 📬 **Pre-recorded voicemail drops** — drops your message after the beep, no operator action needed
- 🎙️ **Per-operator recording profiles** — each team member has their own opener & voicemail recordings
- 🎧 **Auto-bridge via WebRTC** — operators are connected into live calls automatically
- ⏭️ **Auto-advance through contact lists** — voicemails are fully automatic
- 🔐 **Auth with optional MFA** — multi-user login, forced password change on first login, optional TOTP MFA, rate-limited login
- 🎫 **Per-operator WebRTC credentials** — each operator gets their own Telnyx SIP identity, auto-provisioned
- 📊 **Analytics & CSV export** — per-campaign and per-operator stats

### 💰 Why?

| Product | Price | OpenDialer |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Orum | $250/user/mo | **$0 + ~$0.01/min** |
| Nooks | $200+/user/mo | Self-hosted, BYOK |
| PhoneBurner | $140/user/mo | No subscription |
| Kixie | $95/user/mo | Fraction of cost |
| JustCall | $49/user/mo | Full control |

You bring your own Telnyx account. You pay only for minutes used (~$0.01-0.02/min). No per-seat fees, no vendor lock-in.

## ✨ Features

### 📋 Campaign Management
Create calling campaigns with contact lists, opener recordings, and voicemail drops. Set your caller ID, assign recordings, and track campaign progress in real time.

### 👥 Contact Management
- **CSV import** — upload contacts with name, phone, company, email, notes
- **Manual entry** — add contacts one by one
- **Status tracking** — pending, voicemail left, connected, callback, not interested, DNC

### 🎵 Recording Management
Upload MP3/WAV files for opener messages and voicemail drops. Preview recordings in-browser. A/B test different messages across campaigns.

### 📞 Power Dialer (Team Mode)
The main screen — your team sits with headsets on:
- **Parallel dialing** — system dials 3x the number of available operators simultaneously
- **Voicemails are automatic** — AMD detects, waits for beep, drops recording, hangs up, dials more
- **Auto-routing** — when a human answers, the call is automatically routed to the first available operator
- **Auto-bridge** — operator's WebRTC audio is bridged into the live call automatically (no manual "Jump In" needed in team mode)
- **Waiting queue** — if all operators are busy, human-answered calls hold until someone is free
- **Wrap-up flow** — after a call ends, operator enters wrap-up (notes/disposition), then sets available for the next call
- **Pause/Resume/Stop** — admin controls the session; operators join/leave individually

### 👤 Team Management
- **Roles** — admin (manage team, campaigns, start/stop sessions) and operator (join sessions, take calls)
- **Admin Team page** — invite operators by email, assign roles, reset passwords, remove members
- **First-login wizard** — new operators must change their temporary password and set up MFA before using the app

### 🎙️ Recording Profiles
- **Per-operator profiles** — each team member creates named profiles (e.g., "Cold Outreach", "Follow Up")
- **Opener + voicemail combo** — each profile pairs an opener recording with a voicemail drop
- **Activate before dialing** — switch profiles depending on the campaign or call type
- Campaign recordings serve as the default; operator profiles override when bridged

### 📊 Analytics & Export
- Campaign stats: total calls, connects, voicemails, talk time, connect rate
- Per-operator breakdown: calls handled, connects, avg talk time
- Contact progress: visual breakdown by status
- Call disposition: breakdown with percentages
- **CSV export**: contacts, call logs, campaign summaries — import into any CRM or spreadsheet

### Call Transcription
Two paths for transcribing calls — see [docs/transcription.md](docs/transcription.md) for full details:
- **Telnyx Built-in** — real-time transcription via Telnyx's API ($0.025/min), zero infrastructure, 4 engine choices (Telnyx, Google, Deepgram, Azure)
- **Bring Your Own STT** — stream raw call audio via WebSocket to any provider (Deepgram, OpenAI Whisper, AssemblyAI, etc.)

### Authentication & Security
- **Multi-user auth** — email + password login with bcrypt hashing, admin and operator roles
- **Optional MFA** — TOTP two-factor authentication on first login (Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, etc.) — controlled via `REQUIRE_MFA` (default: off)
- **Rate limiting** — login endpoints rate-limited to 5 attempts per 30 seconds via `@fastify/rate-limit`
- **First-login setup** — temporary password from admin → forced change on first login
- **WorkOS SSO** — optional Google, GitHub, or SAML login via WorkOS
- **Session-based** — 24-hour session cookie, sign out anytime from the sidebar
- **Webhook verification** — Telnyx Ed25519 signature verification on incoming webhooks (optional, enable via `TELNYX_PUBLIC_KEY`)
- **Per-operator SIP credentials** — each operator gets their own Telnyx Telephony Credential, auto-provisioned on user creation

### ⚙️ Settings
- Enter your Telnyx API key, Connection ID, and phone number
- Test connectivity from the UI
- Configure webhook URL for Telnyx events

## 🔄 How It Works

This is the core call flow — understanding this is key to understanding the entire app.

```
User clicks "Start Calling" → System dials Contact #1
                                      │
                              call.answered
                                      │
                         Answering Machine Detection
                              /              \

                           │          "Jump In"        │
                call.playback.ended      │        Auto-dial
                           │         Bridge WebRTC     next
                       Hang up       into live call
                           │
                    Auto-dial next
                    (user never
                    touched anything)
```

### Event-by-Event Breakdown

| # | What Happens | Telnyx Event | Server Action |
|---|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | System dials a contact | `call.initiated` | Update UI: "Dialing..." |
| 2 | Someone/something picks up | `call.answered` | AMD starts analyzing |
| 3a | AMD says "machine" | `call.machine.detection.ended` (result=machine) | Wait for the beep |
| 3b | AMD says "human" | `call.machine.detection.ended` (result=human) | Play opener recording, alert user |
| 3c | AMD unsure | `call.machine.detection.ended` (result=not_sure) | Treat as human with warning, play opener |
| 3d | AMD times out (>35s) | *(no event — server timeout)* | Treat as human with warning |
| 4 | Voicemail beep detected | `call.machine.greeting.ended` | Play voicemail drop recording |
| 5 | Recording finishes playing | `call.playback.ended` | If voicemail → hang up → dial next. If opener → wait for user |
| 6 | User clicks "Jump In" | REST API call | Bridge user's WebRTC audio into the live call |
| 6b | Transcription (if enabled) | `call.transcription` | Store transcript line, broadcast to UI |
| 7 | Call ends (any reason) | `call.hangup` | Log result, update contact status, dial next |

### Key Mechanism: `client_state`

Every outbound call carries a base64-encoded JSON payload called `client_state`. This is how the server tracks which campaign and contact a call belongs to across stateless webhook callbacks:

```
dial() → client_state: { campaignId: 1, contactId: 42 }
  ↓
Telnyx sends webhooks with that client_state echoed back
  ↓
Server decodes it → knows which campaign/contact to update
```

### Real-Time Updates: Server-Sent Events (SSE)

The browser connects to `/events` (SSE endpoint). The server pushes events as they happen:

```
Browser ←──── SSE ──── Server ←──── Telnyx Webhooks
  │                      │
  │  call_status_changed │  call.answered
  │  session_status      │  call.machine.detection.ended
  │  call_log_added      │  call.playback.ended
  │  contact_updated     │  call.hangup
```

No polling. No WebSocket complexity. The browser uses the native `EventSource` API which auto-reconnects on failure.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- A [Telnyx](https://telnyx.com) account with:
  - API Key (starts with `KEY_`)
  - A [SIP Connection](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/app/connections) with WebRTC enabled
  - A purchased phone number

### 1. Download & Configure

**Option A — Git clone (recommended):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OpenDialer.git
cd OpenDialer
```

**Option B — Download ZIP (no Git required):**
1. Go to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/yourusername/OpenDialer)
2. Click the green **Code** button → **Download ZIP**
3. Extract the ZIP to a folder (e.g., `C:\Users\you\OpenDialer` on Windows or `~/OpenDialer` on Mac)

**Configure your `.env` file:**

1. Find the file `.env.example` in the project folder
2. Copy it and rename the copy to `.env`
   - **Windows:** Right-click → Copy → Paste → Rename to `.env`
   - **Mac/Linux:** `cp .env.example .env`
3. Open `.env` in any text editor (Notepad, VS Code, TextEdit) and fill in your Telnyx credentials:

```env
TELNYX_API_KEY=KEY_your_key_here
TELNYX_CONNECTION_ID=your_connection_id
TELNYX_PHONE_NUMBER=+1your_number
WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=https://your-public-url

# Admin account (created on first startup — must change password on first login)
DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme
DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourcompany.com

# Database — local SQLite (default) or external libSQL
DATABASE_URL=./data/opendialer.db
```

### 2. Run with Docker Desktop

Make sure **Docker Desktop is running** (you should see the whale icon in your taskbar/menu bar).

Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

> **Windows tip:** In File Explorer, navigate to the OpenDialer folder, click the address bar, type `cmd`, and press Enter. This opens a terminal in the right directory.
>
> **Mac tip:** Right-click the folder in Finder → **Services** → **New Terminal at Folder**.

The first build takes a few minutes. When you see output like:
```
opendialer-app-1  | Server listening on port 3000
```

You're ready. Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

### 3. Managing with Docker Desktop (after first run)

Once the containers are running, you can manage everything from the **Docker Desktop dashboard**:

```
Docker Desktop → Containers
  [▼] opendialer                    Running    [■ Stop] [↻ Restart]
      ├── opendialer-app-1          Running    3000:3000  🔗
      └── opendialer-tunnel-1       Running               (if tunnel enabled)
```

- **Start/Stop** — Click the Stop or Play button on the stack. No terminal needed after first run
- **Open the app** — Click the **port link** (`3000:3000`) next to the app container — it opens `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
- **View logs** — Click any container name to see live logs in the Logs tab
- **Terminal access** — Click a container → Terminal tab to open a shell inside the container
- **Restart after .env changes** — Stop the stack, then Start it again from the dashboard

### 4. Public URL for Webhooks

Telnyx needs to reach your server to send call events. For local development, use [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) (free, no account needed):

```bash
# Quick tunnel — random URL, good for testing
docker compose --profile tunnel up --build

# Check the URL in logs
docker compose logs tunnel
```

Or install `cloudflared` locally:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

Set the URL as your `WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` in the Settings page.

### Development Mode (without Docker)

For contributors or developers who want to work on the code:

```bash
# Install pnpm if needed
npm install -g pnpm

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run both server and frontend
pnpm dev
```

- Backend: http://localhost:3000
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173 (proxies API calls to backend)

## 📖 User Guide — Your First Calling Session

Once OpenDialer is running, follow these steps to make your first calls.

### Step 0: Create Your Admin Account

On first launch, OpenDialer creates a default admin from your `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var:

1. **Login** with your email and the default password
2. **Change your password** (forced on first login)
3. If `REQUIRE_MFA=true`, **set up MFA** — scan the QR code with your authenticator app
4. You're in! Go to the **Team** page to invite operators

On future visits, sign in with your email + password (+ MFA code if enabled).

### Step 1: Configure Telnyx Credentials

1. Go to the **Settings** page in the app
2. Enter your **Telnyx API Key** (starts with `KEY_`)
3. Enter your **SIP Connection ID** — create one at [portal.telnyx.com → SIP Connections](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/app/connections)
   - Make sure **WebRTC** is enabled on the connection (needed for "Jump In")
4. Enter your **Phone Number** in E.164 format (e.g., `+15551234567`) — purchase one from the [Telnyx Number Portal](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/app/numbers/search-numbers)
5. Enter your **Webhook Base URL** — the public URL where Telnyx can reach your server (see [webhooks setup](#3-public-url-for-webhooks) above)
6. Click **Save** and use the **Test Connection** button to verify

### Step 2: Upload Recordings

1. Go to the **Recordings** page
2. Upload an **Opener recording** (MP3 or WAV) — this plays when a human picks up, before you jump in. Example: *"Hi, this is Sarah from Acme Corp — hold on one moment..."*
3. Upload a **Voicemail drop recording** — this plays automatically after the voicemail beep. Example: *"Hey, it's Sarah from Acme. I was calling about... give me a ring back at..."*
4. You can upload multiple recordings and assign different ones per campaign

### Step 3: Create a Campaign

1. Go to the **Campaigns** page and click **Create Campaign**
2. Give it a name (e.g., "Q2 Outbound — West Coast")
3. Set the **Caller ID** — the phone number contacts will see (must be your Telnyx number or a verified number)
4. Select your **Opener recording** and **Voicemail drop recording** from the dropdowns
5. Save the campaign

### Step 4: Import Contacts

1. Go to the **Contacts** page
2. Select your campaign, then either:
   - **Add manually** — enter name, phone (E.164), company, email, notes
   - **Bulk import via CSV** — upload a CSV with columns: `name`, `phone`, `company`, `email`, `notes`. Phone numbers must be in E.164 format (`+1XXXXXXXXXX`)
3. Contacts start with status **Pending** and move through the dialer queue

### Step 5: Start Dialing (Team Mode)

**Admin:**
1. Go to the **Dialer** page, select a campaign, click **Start Calling**
2. The system begins dialing contacts from the queue

**Operators:**
1. Go to the **Dialer** page and click **Join Session**
2. **Put on your headset** — your browser connects via WebRTC
3. The system dials 3x the number of available operators simultaneously
4. Sit back — calls are routed to you automatically:

| What you see | What's happening | What to do |
|-------------|------------------|------------|
| **Available** | You're in the queue, system is dialing | Wait for a human |
| **Voicemail (auto)** | Machine detected → auto-drops voicemail → auto-dials more | Nothing — fully automatic |
| **Call Routed!** | A human answered and you've been selected | You're auto-bridged — talk! |
| **You are LIVE** | Your mic is connected to the contact | Have the conversation |
| **Wrap-up** | Call ended, enter notes/disposition | Click **Done** to go back to available |
| **Waiting for Operator** | Human on the line but all operators busy | Finish your call, the waiting call routes next |

5. **Admin** can **Pause/Resume/Stop** the session. Operators can **Leave** individually
6. After each call, you enter **wrap-up** to log notes, then click **Set Available** for the next one

### Solo Mode (Single Operator)

If only one operator is in the session, it behaves like a traditional power dialer:
- One call at a time, sequential auto-advance
- Manual **Jump In** button when a human answers
- Same voicemail automation

### Step 6: Review Results

1. Go to the **Analytics** page to see campaign stats: total calls, connect rate, voicemails dropped
2. Use **Export CSV** to download contacts, call logs, or a campaign summary for your CRM

### How Calls Work Under the Hood

- **Outbound calls** are placed via Telnyx's REST Call Control API — your server controls the call
- **Your audio** (when you Jump In) goes through WebRTC in your browser via the `@telnyx/webrtc` SDK
- **Bridging** connects the two call legs together so you and the contact can hear each other
- **Transcription** — if enabled on the campaign, real-time transcription auto-starts when you bridge in. Transcripts are stored per call and viewable on the Transcription page
- **AMD error handling** — `not_sure` results are treated as human with a warning; a 35s timeout catches cases where AMD detection never fires
- **State is in-memory** — if the server restarts during a session, active calls are orphaned. The contact list, logs, and transcripts are persisted in the database

## 🌐 Deployment

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

With Cloudflare Tunnel for public HTTPS:

```bash
# Anonymous tunnel (random URL, no account needed)
docker compose --profile tunnel up --build -d

# Named tunnel (permanent custom domain, free Cloudflare account)
# Set CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN in .env first
docker compose --profile tunnel-named up --build -d
```

### Hosting Options

| Option | Cost | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Hetzner VPS + Coolify** | ~$4/mo | Best value. Coolify runs docker-compose natively |
| **Fly.io** | $0-5/mo | Managed. Free tier works for single user |
| **Railway** | $5/mo | Fastest deploy. Connect GitHub → done |
| **Your own server** | Any machine with Docker | `docker compose up` and you're live |

### Database Options

OpenDialer supports local SQLite (default) or any external libSQL-compatible database. Set via environment variables — no code changes needed.

| Option | `DATABASE_URL` | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Local SQLite** (default) | `./data/opendialer.db` | Zero config, data in Docker volume |
| **External libSQL** | `libsql://your-db.example.com` | Set `DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN` too |

The app auto-detects the URL format and connects accordingly. Migrations run the same way on both.

### Windows Support

Works with Docker Desktop (WSL2 backend). Named volumes handle SQLite persistence correctly. See `.gitattributes` for line ending configuration.

## 📊 Data Export

Export your data as CSV from the Analytics page or directly via API:

```bash
# Export all contacts from campaign 1
curl http://localhost:3000/api/analytics/campaigns/1/export/contacts > contacts.csv

# Export call logs from campaign 1
curl http://localhost:3000/api/analytics/campaigns/1/export/calls > call-logs.csv

# Export summary of all campaigns
curl http://localhost:3000/api/analytics/export/summary > summary.csv
```

CSV exports include all fields and are compatible with Excel, Google Sheets, HubSpot, Salesforce, and any CRM that accepts CSV imports.
